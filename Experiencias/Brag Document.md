# Brag Document

## Purpose of the Brag Document 🎯

The Brag Document is great for:

- Capturing the amazing work you’re doing 🌟
- Aligning your work to your company’s career ladder 🪜
- Making sure your work is visible and accessible so your manager doesn’t have to start your performance review from scratch 🔍
- Giving yourself a starting point for building a fantastic resume 📝

# Recap Template 📝

The Recap Template follows the outline of the popular [STAR method](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/the-star-method-for-behavioral-interviews/#:~:text=in%20internship%20postings.-,The%20STAR%20method,emphasize%20what%20you%20learned%20from%20the%20experience%20or%20your%20key%20takeaways.,-The%20percentages%20listed) which serves as the standard for most behavioral interviews. Here’s a breakdown of the template fields, as well as some suggestions for how to get the most out of each section.

## Situation or Task 🌧️

**Purpose:** Give enough context that you or your manager can understand your actions and the goal you were working toward. However, the point is to be concise so try to avoid giving so much information that the necessary context becomes unclear.

**Suggested Format:** A short paragraph or a bulleted list will work fine. Brevity is key here, so be sure to keep it to a few of the most important details.

**Questions to Answer:**

- What is the problem you were trying to solve?
- What is the context that led to your action?

## Action ☀️

**Purpose:** Clearly articulate the actions *you* took. The actions your *team* took are typically irrelevant here, since a performance review or an interview should be focused on you.

**Suggested Format:** A bulleted list is probably best here. This format helps keep each action distinct and makes it easier to scan for important details.

**Questions to Answer:**

- Which specific actions did you take?
- Why did you choose those actions over alternatives?

## Result 🌈

**Purpose:** Demonstrate the impact of your actions. It’s crucial here to link the results back to the relevant metric or goal wherever possible. If measuring the outcome is impossible, be sure to link your results to specific points on your career ladder.

**Suggested Format:** I highly suggest an abbreviated [XYZ format](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html#:~:text=Google%20describes%20this%20as%3A%20%22Accomplished%20%5BX%5D%20as%20measured%20by%20%5BY%5D%2C%20by%20doing%20%5BZ%5D.%22%20But%20just%20to%20make%20it%20easier%20to%20remember%2C%20let%27s%20shorten%20it%20to%20X%2DY%2DZ.%C2%A0%C2%A0) for this — “Achieved X as measured by Y”. I have cut out the `Z` here because it is captured by the Action section.

**Questions to Answer:**

- What was the outcome?
- How was the outcome measured?

# Database Views 👀

This template comes with five views:

- 💾  **Recap Database**: This is the main database where you can easily create and edit the recaps of your accomplishments.
- ⚠️. **Action Required:** This view helps you easily narrow down the items that are still in progress so that you know what needs your attention.
- ⬅️  **Quarterly Rewind:** Use the quarterly rewind to kick-start your quarterly review. This gives your manager a great starting point for performance reviews.
- ⏪  **Yearly Rewind:** Promotions and raises are generally decided based on a longer track-record of performance. This view gives your manager everything they need to know to build a case for you.
- 🏆  **Biggest Wins:** The biggest wins view sorts by level of impact. Use this view to kick-start your resume, prepare for interviews, or highlight your biggest accomplishments.
